# Face Mask Detection

### Using python libraries namely Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV. model used is the MobileNetV2 of convolutional neural network to classify whether the person is wearning mask or not and FaceNet model is used to extract high-quality features from faces, called face embeddings, that can then be used to train a face identification system
